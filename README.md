# openstick-sms2email
A python application for ModemManager ( specifically built for my own openstick 4G/LTE debian stick ) 4G/LTE modems and processing SMS messages sent to it and forwarding as email. ( Note: this application does NOT have any features to send the SMS, for my use case, I wrote different code to handle that. )

## Install
Clone the git repo and copy the <code>config.example.py</code> file to <code>config.py</code>.<br>
Run it by typing command <code>python3 main.py</code>.
